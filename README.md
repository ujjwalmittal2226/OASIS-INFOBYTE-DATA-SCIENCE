##TASK1:
Iris Flower Classification

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

    In this task, I took Iris Flower dataset and performed Logistic Regression Algorithm to make model.
    It finally categorized flowers into species.
    I got an accuracy of 97.37% and It demonstrates that the model I created is extremely accurate.
    And I predicted the Species using a fresh set of data and obtained an accurate result.

TASK2:
Unemplotment Analysis With Python

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

    In this task, I use India's Unemployee Analysis dataset. And carried out many analyses using Python.
    I analysed the data using pandas and numpy to draw conclusions.
    I have done several data visualizations and animations using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
    It provides a thorough picture of the unemployment situation across states, aiding in making wise decisions.

TASK3 
Car Price Prediciton With Machine Learning

    In this task, I took Car Price dataset and performed Linear Regression and Lasso Regression Algorithms to make model.
    Many analyses of the dataset were performed.
    Many visualizations of the dataset were created.
    Finally, I plotted a graph for actual vs. predicted values.

TASK4 

Email Spam Detection With Machine Learning

    In this task, I used the SMS Spam collection dataset.
    Then, I trained the model using a Count Vectorizer and Logistic Regression Algorithms.
    There are many analyses that were done, and a few visualizations were also done.
    Finally, Using the MultinomialNB Algorithm, made a model and predicted using custom words.

TASK 5
Conclusion

    In this task, I have used the Advertising Dataset.
    Then, I did an analysis and visualization of the dataset.
    And then I trained the model using Linear Regression Algorithm and predicted the values.
    Made a dataframe of actual and predicted values.
    Finally, made a visualization of actual and predicted values.
